## What is Omnia?

Omnia is a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of AI agents. It provides custom resources for defining agent configurations, prompt packs, and tool registries, enabling you to deploy intelligent agents at scale.

## Quick Start

Install Omnia using Helm:

```bash
helm repo add omnia https://altairalabs.github.io/omnia/charts
helm install omnia omnia/omnia --namespace omnia-system --create-namespace
```

Then deploy your first agent:

```yaml
apiVersion: omnia.altairalabs.ai/v1alpha1
kind: AgentRuntime
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  replicas: 1
  providerRef:
    name: my-provider
  promptPackRef:
    name: my-promptpack
```
