                            Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                            Valid operators are Exists, Equal, Lt, and Gt. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                            Lt and Gt perform numeric comparisons (requires feature gate TaintTolerationComparisonOperators).

                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                            If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
