# API Surface Changelog

Changes to any API surface (REST, gRPC, WebSocket) should be logged here
so that parallel workstreams have visibility into contract changes.

When modifying files in `internal/session/api/`, `internal/facade/protocol.go`,
or `api/proto/`, add an entry below with the date, affected API, and reason.

## 2026-03-15
- **WebSocket protocol**: Removed `execution` field from `ToolCallInfo`
  - Go struct: `internal/facade/protocol.go:ToolCallInfo`
  - Reason: All tool calls sent over WebSocket are client-side by definition. Server-side tool calls are filtered at the facade and never forwarded.
  - Generated types updated: `dashboard/src/types/generated/websocket.ts`

## 2026-03-14
- **WebSocket protocol**: Added `tool_result` client message type and `ClientToolResultInfo` struct
  - Go struct: `internal/facade/protocol.go:ClientToolResultInfo`
  - Reason: Client-side tool execution (#617) requires the dashboard to send tool results back
- **gRPC protocol**: Removed `tool_result` from `ServerMessage` oneof
  - Proto: `api/proto/runtime/v1/runtime.proto`
  - Reason: Server-side tool results are handled internally by the runtime, not sent to the facade
